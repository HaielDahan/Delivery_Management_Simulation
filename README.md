## Courier Simulation with Java

This project is a multi-threaded Courier simulation implemented in Java, focusing on modeling and optimizing courier delivery operations. The simulation incorporates design patterns and utilizes Swing for the graphical user interface (GUI).

### Features

- **Multi-threaded simulation:** The project utilizes multi-threading to simulate concurrent processes involved in courier operations, such as package handling, route planning, and delivery scheduling.

- **Design patterns:** Design patterns are employed to ensure modular and scalable code architecture, promoting code reusability and maintainability.

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** The simulation includes a user-friendly GUI developed with Swing, enabling users to interact with the simulation, visualize courier movements, track package statuses, and monitor performance metrics.

### How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.

3. Compile and run the main Java file to start the simulation.

4. Use the GUI to interact with the simulation, visualize courier movements, and monitor package statuses.

### Requirements

- Java 8 or higher
- Java IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA)
