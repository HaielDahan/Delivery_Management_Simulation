🚚 **Courier Simulation with Java** 📦

This project is a multi-threaded Courier simulation implemented in Java, focusing on modeling and optimizing courier delivery operations. The simulation incorporates design patterns and utilizes Swing for the graphical user interface (GUI). 📊

🔹 **Features**
- Multi-threaded simulation: The project utilizes multi-threading to simulate concurrent processes involved in courier operations, such as package handling, route planning, and delivery scheduling. 🔄
- Design patterns: Design patterns are employed to ensure modular and scalable code architecture, promoting code reusability and maintainability. 🧩
- Graphical User Interface (GUI): The simulation includes a user-friendly GUI developed with Swing, enabling users to interact with the simulation, visualize courier movements, track package statuses, and monitor performance metrics. 🖥️

🔹 **How to Use**
1. Clone the repository to your local machine. ⬇️
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE. 👩‍💻
3. Compile and run the main Java file to start the simulation. ▶️
4. Use the GUI to interact with the simulation, visualize courier movements, and monitor package statuses. 📈

🔹 **Requirements**
- Java 8 or higher ☕
- Java IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA) 💻
